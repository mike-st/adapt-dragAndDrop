Installation
------------

I updated an already existing Drag n Drop Component and made it so it will work now with the Adapt Authoring Tool. I also added some new classes in the less file to make it work better on a mobile environment. Instead of just showing borders around the right or wrong choices I added accessible checkmarks or x's for people that our colour blind.

Usage
-----
Once installed, the component can be used as a drag and drop question component.

For example JSON format, see<br/>
